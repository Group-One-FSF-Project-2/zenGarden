This is our zen garden project for our software development bootcamp. 

# zenGarden

ZenGarden is a project we created to display our knowledge of creating a full stack application. We were asked to create an application using MVC Architecture that would allow us to input data to a UI interface and then store that data in a database. 
## Installation

Among the technologies and packages we used included:
-sequelize, node, express-handlebars, nodemon, dotenv, pg, bcrypt, express-sessions, connect- sessions-sequelize, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

To install our program you will run npm i to install the packages and dependencies.
To run the seed data the command npm run seed will be used.
To run the nodemon server the command npm run watch will be used.

## Usage

This application will allow the user to register, login and logout to a UI that can generate a garden individual garden plot with a selection of various plants and store that data so they can retrieve their garden and add new plant data to it.
